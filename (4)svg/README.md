# Homework Week 4 - SVG

The Data: Data was collected from personal records based on water consumption for the month of August 2022. It ranged from zero glasses and maxed at 8 (even if actual consumption was higher).

The Viz: SVG water drop icons were created and layed out in rows of seven, as if to represent the days of the week. Another SVG was overlayed on top in order cover a certain proportion of the image, giving the illusion that the droplet is filled proportional to the amount of water consumed.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/tkcram/pivf22/tree/main/(4)svg) and the output image is available below
