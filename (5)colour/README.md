# Homework Week 5 - Colour

## The Concept
For this week's assignment, I wanted to experiment with using colour through the lens of synesthesia. That is, creating a visual representation for something that is typically non-visual. The initial approach was to take advantage of the fact that both light and sound are waveforms, but this didn't seem to capture the complexity of the music. Instead I decided to abstract up a level. Knowing that musical chords are often composed of three notes, I associated that with the fact that colour can be represented by ratios of the three primaries. For example, an F chord is composed of the F, A, and C notes. Scaling Ab to G# to 0-255, this equates to [175,16,74] - or a lovely maroon. While the initial concept is still quite rough, it creates some interesting visual results that I feel would be interesting to explore further.

## The Data
Data for this project was created by hand, and broken into two .csv files

chords.csv contains the basic major and minor chords (and sevenths, although not used), and the notes that comprise them.

songs.csv contains six songs selected semi-randomly (i.e. whatever we thought of first) broken down by artist, song title, and the first five chords based on a quick google search. This data is mostly used as a proof of concept, and is not intended to be exact or comprehensive. 

## The Viz
The basic look of the viz is inspired by the [Colours of Wes Anderson](https://duanefernandez.tumblr.com/image/47637255662) viz we reviewed in class. The exact algorithm for determining the colours is uncertain, but showing the colours as swatches next to the song information gives the vibe I'm wishing to convey. I'm also working on a variable number of chords, which will help provide some insight into the complexity of the songs.

Due to the nature of the concept, it does require a little bit of explaining and am currently unsure how to accomplish that in a intuitive way. It also needs a lot of polish, such as in the font-book

## The Code
The viz was created in D3 using what essentially amounts to a nested for-loop. For each song, it creates a series of rectangles for each chord in the data (the number of chords is currently hard-coded). The fill for each box is generated by looking up the three notes associated with the chord, looking up how far along the spectrum<sup>1<sup> each note is, scaling that to a value from 0-255, and returning an rbg() colour using those three values.
