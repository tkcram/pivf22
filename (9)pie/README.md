# Homework Week 8 - Interactivity

## The Concept
The goal of this week's assignment was to use pie charts in small multiples to display different US demographic data, broken down by state. The idea was to lay out the pie charts, and allow the user to select which demographics to display and change accordingly. Unfortunately, getting the chart to work with only one set of data proved to be a significant challenge, and the rest was left for future work. 

## The Data
Data was sourced from the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/state-category/demographics-and-the-economy/population/). This included demographic proportions for each of the 50 states, plus Puerto Rico and the US overall. Demographics included age, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and if they had children.

## The Viz
Small multiples were chosen to display a significant amount of information. In theory these could be arranged to match their geographic position, but for now this is sufficient. Colours were picked to be high contrast, and white text to be legible against them. Due to the nature of D3.pie, the majority slice was shown on the right hand side, meaning that there was little consistency between charts
